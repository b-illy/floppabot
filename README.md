# floppabot

## overview

A general purpose modular Discord bot written in JS using [eris](https://github.com/abalabahaha/eris).

## dependencies

- `npm` - any modern version should work fine, LTS or otherwise.
- `nodejs` - this bot was made with the latest nodejs versions in mind (`18.x`) and will not work with certain older versions, such as `12.x` provided in Ubuntu's repositories.
- npm dependencies - these will all be installed with a simple `npm install` (see setup section).

## setup

- Access the [developer portal](https://discord.com/developers/applications). You will need to create a new application and a new bot account for that application (keep the token handy).
- Setup the `.env` file, using `.env-example` as a base to guide you.
- Run `npm install` to install all npm dependencies.

## running

Run using `npm start` in correct directory.
